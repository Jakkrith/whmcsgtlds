whmcs New gTLDs Whois Server for whoisservers.php

This is an attempt to create a full list of new gTLDs for the whoisservers.php associated with whmcs whois lookup.
The list will be based on IANA and OpenSRS domain availability, we will expand based on user commits if the TLDs are not supported by OpenSRS

If you have any questions, please post them here, this project is sponsored by <a href="https://www.zenithmedia.ca/opensrs/">Zenith Media Canada</a> this list is being used by our domain checking tool. https://www.zenithmedia.ca/portal/domainchecker.php
